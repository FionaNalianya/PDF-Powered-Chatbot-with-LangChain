# PDF-Powered-Chatbot-with-LangChain
 
I created a Langchain App to chat with multiple PDF files using the ChatGPT API and Huggingface Language Models. This powerful chatbot allows you to ask questions about your multiple PDFs using LangChain and ChatGPT API. I harnessed the capabilities of LangChain, a cutting-edge framework for developing language model-powered applications. Powered by ChatGPT, an advanced AI language model, my chatbot implementation enables me to interact with my PDF documents in a whole new way. I also explored the utilization of Huggingface language models to enhance the chatbot's performance.

I learned how to integrate LangChain into my application, leveraging its data-awareness and agentic features, allowing my language model to tap into various data sources and interact with its environment seamlessly.
